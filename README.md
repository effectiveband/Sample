## Why we created this sample
This project has been created due to show our approach to everyone within the team.
It's a quite simple android app, but it demonstrates core features of the way we develop big and scalable production apps.
## How to use this sample
This sample includes some basic cases that are needed almost for any android app.
So, if you need to setup a new project, it can help you as an example how everything should work overall.
It's not a bootstrap project, don't use it as a template to start from.
